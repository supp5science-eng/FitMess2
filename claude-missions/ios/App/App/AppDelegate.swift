    // register, and UIKit answers here, on the app delegate. The Capacitor
    // plugin listens for these two notifications and turns them into the
    // `registration` / `registrationError` events that
    // `src/lib/push/native.ts` awaits.
    //
    // Leave them out and nothing errors: registration simply never completes,
    // the JS side waits out its timeout, and the user is told to check their
    // internet connection about a problem that is entirely ours.
